# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- apps/frontend: React + Vite app (UI). Env files: `apps/frontend/.env.development` (see `.env.default`).
- apps/api: NestJS service (API). Env files: `apps/api/.env` (see `.env.default`).
- libs: Shared TypeScript utilities and UI modules used by apps.
- scripts, docs, swagger-spec.json: Helper scripts, documentation, and OpenAPI spec.
- dist, coverage: Build outputs and test coverage (generated).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- Install: `npm install`
- Start frontend: `npm run dev` (Vite dev server on http://localhost:5173)
- Start API: `npm run api` (Nest on http://localhost:3001)
- Both apps: `npm run serveFrontendAndApi`
- Build frontend/API/all: `npm run build`, `npm run build:api`, `npm run build:all`
- Tests: `npm run test` (API), `npm run test:frontend`, coverage with `npm run coverage`
- Lint/format: `npm run lint`, `npm run lint:fix`, staged formatting via pre-commit
- Local infra (Mongo/Redis): `docker compose up -d` (see `docker-compose.yml`)

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Stack: TypeScript, React 18, NestJS 11, Nx workspace.
- Linting: ESLint (Airbnb + TypeScript, a11y, import rules). Run `npm run lint`.
- When linting, prefer linting only the changed files instead of the full project:
  - `npx eslint path/to/changed/file.ts --quiet`
  - Only run `npm run lint` for final verification before commits
- Formatting: Prettier (2 spaces, 120 cols, single quotes, trailing commas). Run `npm run format`.
- React: Function components as arrow functions; allow prop spreading; avoid `console` except `info|warn|error`.
- Shared code lives under `libs/`, move utility functions, types, and constants always there (in separate files). Do not move UI components there.
- File names: The file name should match the default export name.
- Never comment in the code.
- Prefer default exports over named exports. Default export at the end of the file.
- Use const objects and derived types instead of enums.
- Use the name "delete" over "remove".
- Always import React hooks at the top of the file, do not use `React.useEffect` syntax.
- In React use our `cn()` function for clsx classNames.
- Do not use magic strings. Always use constants.
- In NestJS services, use static Logger calls with the service name as context: `Logger.log('message', ServiceName.name)`, `Logger.error('message', ServiceName.name)`. Do not create instance logger with `private readonly logger = new Logger()`.
- In React, use `eduApi` (axios) from `@/api/eduApi` for API calls instead of native `fetch`. API calls should be placed in Zustand stores, not in components. Use `ResponseType.BLOB` for blob responses and `handleApiError` for error handling.
- All newly added zustand stores must be reset in apps/frontend/src/store/utils/cleanAllStores.ts
- Always search the code for existing patterns, functions, classes, types, and constants before creating new ones.
- Use generic types over unsafe type casting.
- Migrations MUST always increase the schema version number so later migrations are triggered.
- Only use @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons for icons
- Many UI components are wrappers for shadcn/@radix-ui components (component/filename postfix with "SH"). We use our custom wrappers instead.
- Instead of using manual URLSearchParams, build it with axios's built-in params option

## Testing Guidelines

- Frontend/libs: Vitest; setup at `apps/frontend/test/vitest.setup.ts`.
- API: Jest; config under `apps/api/jest.config.ts`.
- Conventions: Co-locate tests with source using `*.spec.ts(x)` or project `test/` folders.
- Run: `npm run test:frontend` for UI, `npm run test:api` for API; add assertions and keep tests fast and deterministic.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Commits: Use imperative mood, small focused changes, reference issues (e.g., `Fix bulletin formatting (#1125)`).
- Branches: Short, descriptive names (e.g., `1120-add-support-for-parent-role`).
- PRs: Include problem, approach, testing notes, linked issues, and screenshots/GIFs for UI. Ensure CI passes and `npm run lint` is clean.

## Security & Configuration Tips

- Do not commit secrets. Use `.env` files per app and required OIDC certificate file in repo root (see README).
- Pre-commit runs checks (circular deps, translations, filenames, license headers). Fix before pushing.
